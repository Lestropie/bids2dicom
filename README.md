## `bids2dicom`

The goal of this software project is to create a BIDS App
that aggregates image data stored in BIDS format (whether raw or derivative),
and produces a DICOM dataset that is appropriately formatted and curated
to be received by a service designed for accepting DICOM data.

For instance, this could be used to include the outcomes of image processing pipelines
in a set of DICOM data submitted for radiological assessment
that could otherwise consist exclusively of unprocessed data.

Currently this project is only in the definition phase.
Relevant discussions wil lbe found in the [issue list](https://github.com/Lestropie/bids2dicom/issues).
